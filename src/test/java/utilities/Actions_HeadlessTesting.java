    -build() and perform() methods
    - build() method is used to get keyboard or mouse
    action to be ready to perform, but it is
    optional with new version
    - perform() method is used to perform ready
    keyboard or mouse action to operate

    required to perform a keyboard or mouse action,
    but we must use perform() method after each
    action
